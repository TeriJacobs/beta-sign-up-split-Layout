## Beta sign-up split layout screen

My task  was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The designs are in JPG static format, opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, which has helped to train your eye when developing. This means that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. which in future will help when I'm working on real projects, but do have access to full design files.

Within the `style-guide.md` contains the information for the color palette and fonts.

**Since this was my first project built from start to finish, I decided to steer away from frameworks such as Bootstrap, in order to get a better understanding of the correspondence between CSS and HTML.**
